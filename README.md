# ðŸ“Š Stock Market Conflict Impact Pipeline

This project tracks and visualizes how major global conflicts influence stock prices of key companies across the **Banking**, **Defense**, and **Energy** sectors.

We use **Apache Airflow** (via Docker) to schedule a daily pipeline that fetches stock data using Yahoo Finance and extracts relevant slices around specific events. The data is then visualized in **Power BI**.

## âœ… Steps to Run This Project

# 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GWRAD/Stock-Market-Conflict-Impact--ETL.git
cd stock-conflict-airflow-pipeline

# 2. Setup Apache Airflow Using Docker

Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed.
curl -LfO https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.8.2/docker-compose.yaml
mkdir -p dags logs plugins
echo "AIRFLOW_UID=50000" > .env

Start Airflow:
docker compose up airflow-init
docker compose up

# 3. Open Airflow UI

Once all containers are up, access the Airflow UI at:

[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

- **Username**: `airflow`
- **Password**: `airflow`

Enable the `stock_etl_cof` DAG from the dashboard to start the daily pipeline.

---

# 4. Check Generated Files

After the DAG runs, check the `event_windows/` folder.  
Youâ€™ll find files like:
COF_Iran_Israel_War_2025.csv
JPM_India_Pakistan_Sinddor_2025.csv



These contain Â±5-day stock price windows around each selected conflict.

---

# 5. Open Power BI Report

1. Open `PowerBI_Report.pbix`  
2. Make sure folder path to `event_windows/` is set correctly  
3. Click `Home > Refresh` to load new data

---

# âœ… Done!

You now have a live dashboard analyzing the impact of global conflicts on key sector stocks using:

- **Automated ETL with Airflow**
- **Historical finance data via Yahoo**
- **Visualized in Power BI**
