# ðŸ“Š Stock Market Conflict Impact Pipeline

This project tracks and visualizes how major global conflicts influence stock prices of key companies across the **Banking**, **Defense**, and **Energy** sectors.

We use **Apache Airflow** (via Docker) to schedule a daily pipeline that fetches stock data using Yahoo Finance and extracts relevant slices around specific events. The data is then visualized in **Power BI**.
